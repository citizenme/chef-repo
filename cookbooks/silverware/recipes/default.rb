# FIXME: Announce once used node.set instead of node.default, resulting
#  in announcements that persisted even after the announcing cookbook
#  was removed from the run-list. This removes those stale values; once
#  it has been run everywhere in the organization, it is safe to remove.
# Since it is not inherently dangerous, I recommend leaving it in place
#  until silverware v4.
